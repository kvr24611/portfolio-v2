# Technical Decisions

## Framework: Astro

**Decision date:** 2026-02-25

**Options considered:** Astro, Next.js, React

**Why Astro:**
- Purpose built for content sites and portfolios
- Ships zero JavaScript by default — extremely fast
- Simpler learning curve, less boilerplate
- Supports React, Tailwind, and TypeScript out of the box
- Free deployment on Vercel or Cloudflare Pages with preview environments

**Trade-offs:**
- Less marketable than Next.js/React in job market
- Not ideal if backend/API routes are needed in future
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Next.js
